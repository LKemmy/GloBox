# Globox A/B Testing Project

Welcome to the Globox A/B Testing Project repository! This project focuses on conducting an A/B test of a banner on the Globox website to see if the introduction of the banner would lead to an increase in conversion rates and average spending. Through SQL database querying, statistical analysis in Google Sheets, data visualization in Tableau, and the creation of a comprehensive report, I aim to derive valuable insights to optimize user engagement and conversions.

## Key Features

- **Database Querying:** Using SQL to retrieve relevant data from Globox's database, ensuring a robust foundation for analysis.

- **A/B Test Analysis:** Statistical analysis in Google Sheets enabled me to compare and evaluate user engagement and conversion rates.

- **Data Visualisation:** Tableau visualisations provide a clear and concise representation of the A/B test results.

- **Insights and Recommendations:** The report presents actionable insights and recommendations for optimising Globox's banner design and user experience.
